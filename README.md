# OSM Series 5
This repository contains everything related to the 5th series within Open Source Malaria (OSM).

The series was started via a donation of samples from Professor Helen Hailes at the Department of Chemistry at University College London. There is literature evidence that these samples may possess antimalarial activity. We are currently securing approval for their biological evaluation.
